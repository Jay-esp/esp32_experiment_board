# esp32_experiment_board
Experiment board for ESP32 38 pins<br />
ESP32 boards don't fit properly in the classic white breadboards, in my opinion the pins used in modules are too big for those breadboards anyway. I usually "air wire" the connenctions between modules and the ESP32 with "dupont" wires.<br />
The printing on the ESP32 boards is usually terrible, very hard to read, some labels do not show the GPIO number but rather one of their functions.
For these reasons i designed this experiment board.<br />
Only for the 38 pin ESP32.<br />
Readable and sensible pin labels.<br />
Islands for ground, 5V and 3.3V.<br />
3 connections per ESP32 pin.<br />
Connectors can be pin or socket.<br />
On the sides room to hook up modules, 1 connection per module pin.<br />
Designed in Kicad 8, all files including gerber and drill files are in the ZIP file.<br />
Make sure you have the correct ESP32 because all GND pins are tied together.<br />
PDF's contain both layers for those who want to do toner transfer.<br />
